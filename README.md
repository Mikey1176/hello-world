Learning new skills to grow and add value.

Hello!

My name is Michael and I am currently enrolled in a free coding class.  So far I am enjoying the course because it is hands on and I am able to create.  In the past I have struggled with technology and computers which is why I am interested in learning more about technology.  Also, I believe that learning how to code will allow me to have fun and use my creativity to develop and design websites and more.
